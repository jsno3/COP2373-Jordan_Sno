Description for Programming Exercise CSV (Writer):
	The purpose of this program is to allow an instructor to input the number of students
	they wish to enter into a CSV file, and then the program will iterate through a loop to enter
	the student's first name, last name, and their grades for three separate exams.

Variables:
	main(function): entries_amount, new_file, fieldnames, csv_writer, first, last, exam_1, exam_2, exam_3, d


Functions:
	main

Steps:
	Import csv

	
	Define main

		Set variable 'entries_amount' equal to the input from the user dictating how many students they wish to enter

		Open 'grades.csv' as 'new_file' in write mode, using the 'with' keyword, and set newline=''

			Define variable 'fieldnames' to be used in when writing the csv file

			Define variable 'csv_writer' and set it equal to 'csv.DictWriter(new_file, fieldnames=fieldnames)'

			Write headers (First Name, Last Name, Exam 1, Exam 2, Exam 3) for better organization

			For loop, for 'i' in the range of 'entries_amount' (the number of students to be entered):

				Set variable 'first' equal to the input for string: 'Enter Student's First Name: '

				Set variable 'last' equal to the input for string: 'Enter Student's Last Name: '

				Set variable 'exam_1' equal to the input for string: 'Enter Student's Grade for Exam 1: '

				Set variable 'exam_2' equal to the input for string: 'Enter Student's Grade for Exam 2: '

				Set variable 'exam_3' equal to the input for string: 'Enter Student's Grade for Exam 3: '

				Create variable 'd' and set it equal to a dictionary that assigns the declared fields (keys) with the inputted related data (values)

				Write a new row to 'grades.csv' passing in the dictionary 'd'
				

	Call main
