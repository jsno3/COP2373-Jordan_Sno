Description for Chapter 6, 6A:
	This program is intended to validate phone numbers, social security numbers, and zip codes
	using regular expressions. Once the program receives input for all three it will display if they
	are valid entries for the specified type.

Variables:
	valid_phone_number(function): pattern, phone_number

	valid_social_security_number(function): pattern, ssn

	valid_zip_code(function): pattern, zip_code

	main(function): phone_number, ssn, zip_code

Functions:
	valid_phone_number	

	valid_social_security_number

	valid_zip_code

	main

Steps:
	Import re

	
	Define "valid_phone_number" and pass in variable "phone_number"

		Create a variable "pattern" and set it equal to a raw string that identifies
    		the acceptable format of an entered "phone_number"

		Return a boolean expression based off of the result of matching the defined "pattern" and entered "phone_number"


	Define "valid_social_security_number" and pass in variable "ssn"

		Create a variable "pattern" and set it equal to a raw string that identifies
	    	the acceptable format of an entered "ssn"

		Return a boolean expression based off of the result of matching the defined "pattern" and entered "ssn"


	Define "valid_zip_code" and pass in variable "zip_code"

		Create a variable "pattern" and set it equal to a raw string that identifies
    		the acceptable format of an entered "zip_code"

		Return a boolean expression based off of the result of matching the defined "pattern" and entered "zip_code"


	Define main

		Create variable "phone_number" and set it equal to the input of a phone number from the user
		
		Create variable "ssn" and set it equal to the input of a social security number from the user

		Create variable "zip_code" and set it equal to the input of a zip code from the user

		Print True/False answer if the entered "phone_number" is valid

		Print True/False answer if the entered "ssn" is valid

		Print True/False answer if the entered "zip_code" is valid
		

	Call main
