Description for Chapter 7, 7A:
	This program is intended to define a pattern using regular expressions that will
	be used to separate and count any number of sentences that the user enters.

Variables:
	main(function): pattern, entry, number_of_sentences, length


Functions:
	main

Steps:
	Import re

	
	Define main

		Create a variable "pattern" and set it equal to a raw string that identifies 
		the start and the end of a sentence and takes everything in between the two.


		Create a variable "entry" and set it equal to a string inputted by the user.

		Create a variable "number_of_sentences" and set it equal to the result of 
		referencing "entry" with "pattern" and use the flag "DOTALL" to capture sentences on more than one line.

		Create a variable "length" that is set to the value of the length of "number_of_sentences"

		For loop:
		
			For "sentence" in "number_of_sentences" print("sentence")

		Print a formatted string that displays the number of sentences that the user entered



	Create dunder method to have "main" not run if my script is imported

	Call main
