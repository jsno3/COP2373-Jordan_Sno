Description for Chapter 10, 10A:
	The purpose of this program is to create a class named "Money" that inherits "Decimal"
	and expands upon its functionality. The class has been extended to support basic addition,
	subtraction, multiplication, and division. Also, two functions 'main' and 'test_func' have been
	added to work in conjunction with one another to test the class's functionality and methods.

Variables:
	Money(Decimal)(class w/ inheritance): v, units, value

	main(function): test(global) and v

	test_func(function): selection and v

Functions:
	main
	
	test_func
Steps:

	Import Decimal from decimal


	Define class 'Money' passing in 'Decimal' for inheritance


		Use __new__ to call the superclass version of __new__, pass in 'cls' to reference the class,
 		'v' to reference the amount of money, and "units='USD'" to assign 'USD' to the money in said class

			return the superclass version of __new__


		Initialize variables 'v' and 'units'

			Assign 'self.v' to the variable 'v'

			Assign 'self.units' to the variable 'units'

		
		Define __str__(self) to return a formatted string containing 'self.v' and 'self.units'

			Return the formatted string containing 'self.v' and 'self.units'

		
		Define __add__ passing in 'self' and 'value'

			Add variables 'self.v' and 'value' and set 'self.v' equal to the result

			Return the value of 'self'

		
		Define __sub__ passing in 'self' and 'value'

			Subtract variables 'self.v' and 'value' and set 'self.v' equal to the result

			Return the value of 'self'
		
		
		Define __mul__ passing in 'self' and 'value'

			Multiply variables 'self.v' any 'value' and set 'self.v' equal to the result

			Return the value of 'self'


		Define __truediv__ passing in 'self' and 'value'

			Divide variable 'self.v' by 'value' and set 'self.v' equal to the result

			Return the value of 'self'

	
	Define function 'main'

		Declare variable 'test' as a global variable

		Print statement greeting the user

		Set variable 'v' equal to a string converted to a 'Decimal' from the user entering how much money they have

		Set 'test' equal to class 'Money' with the 'v' passed in and 'units' set to 'USD'

		Print 'test' to user to display how much money they have


	Call 'main'


	Define function 'test_func' to test class 'Money(Decimal)'

		Print multiple strings that outline the methods available in this program

		Set variable 'selection' equal to the inputted value from the user (to make a selection from the given options)

		If/elif/else statement, if 'selection' is '1' call the 'add' method

			Set variable 'v' equal to a string converted to a 'Decimal' that specifies how much the user would like to
        		add to the existing amount of money

			Print the result of variable 'test' added to variable 'v' through the 'add' method

		Elif statement, if 'selection' is '2' call the 'sub' method

       			Set variable 'v' equal to a string converted to a 'Decimal' that specifies how much the user would like to
        		subtract from the existing amount of money

			Print the result of variable 'v' subtracted from variable 'test' through the 'sub' method

		Elif statement, if 'selection' is '3' call the 'mul' method

			Set variable 'v' equal to a string converted to a 'Decimal' that specifies how much the user would like to
        		multiply their existing amount of money by

			Print the result of variable 'test' multiplied by variable 'v' through the 'mul' method

		Elif statement, if 'selection' is '4' call the 'truediv' method

	        	Set variable 'v' equal to a string converted to a 'Decimal' that specifies how much the user would like to
        		divide their existing amount of money by

			Print the result of variable 'test' divided by variable 'v' through the 'truediv' method
        		(I used 'truediv' for better results with decimals and rounding)

		Elif statement, if 'selection' is '5' print 'test' and show the user how much money they have

			Print 'test'

		Elif statement, if 'selection' is '6' exit the program

	        	Exit the program

		Else statement, print 'That is not a valid selection and restart the test function

			Print 'That is not a valid selection'
			
			Call 'test_func'

		Call 'test_func'


Call 'test_func'
