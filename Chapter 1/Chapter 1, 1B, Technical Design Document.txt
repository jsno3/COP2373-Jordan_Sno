Description for Chapter 1, 1B:
	This program simulates a Magic 8 ball (designed to imitate a toy that displays a random response to yes or no questions.)
		Main opens (or creates the file if it does not exist) file called "8ball_responses.txt."
		A list named "responses" is created to easily layout the Magic 8 ball's phrases.
		"responses" is then iterated through and written to the file: "8ball_responses.txt."
		The file is closed.

Variables:
	main: f, responses, response

	secondary: response_list, clean, clean_dictionary (global variable), phrase, response, x
	
	tertiary: y and z

Functions:
	main
	secondary
	tertiary

Steps:
	Create main

	Define main:

		Main opens (or creates the file if it does not exist) file called "8ball_responses.txt."
		A list named "responses" is created to easily layout the Magic 8 ball's phrases.
		"responses" is then iterated through and written to the file: "8ball_responses.txt."
		The file is closed.

Call main

	Create secondary

	Define secondary:

		Secondary opens and returns a list containing each line in the file: "8ball_responses.txt" as a list item and assigns it to the variable: "response_list"
		Define a list named: "clean" to iterate through "response_list" and strip "\n" from each element.
		Set "clean_dictionary" to a global variable to be later used in "tertiary."
		Create an empty dictionary: "clean_dictionary" to match each response with an integer to be later randomly selected and displayed.
		Create an integer variable: "x" to be used as the keys for "clean_dictionary."
		Iterate through each string in "response_list" and strip "\n" from each element. Append the resulting string to the list: "clean."
		Iterate through list: "clean" and assign each response to dictionary: "clean_dictionary" with a unique integer as their key.

Call secondary

	Create tertiary

	Define tertiary:

		Tertiary imports random to be later used to generate a random integer in a specified range.
		Define a variable: "y" that accepts input to either ask a yes/no question or say "goodbye" to end the program.
		
		If/else statement. 

			If variable "y" is equivalent to "goodbye" print: "Thanks for playing! Goodbye!" and exit the program.
		
		
			Else, (variable "y" states anything other than "goodbye"): 
				Define variable "z" and assign it a random integer in the range of "clean_dictionary."
				Print a "clean_dictionary" value based off of the generated key.
				Call tertiary.

Call Tertiary
